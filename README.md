# STATIC FILES FOR THE SMS REACT FRONT END
I made this static file server after realizing that I couldn't serve my react production build with laravel server

It also works with [this](https://github.com/Othie12/Laravel-School-Management-system) laravel backend.

## What you need to know
- The static files are being served by a golang static file server
